Notes on the BetterPlaces app:

Requirements:

    
1: Create model to manage stored data

    Photo
        title                   (String)
        photoDescription        (String)
        uniqueId                (String)
        favorite                (BOOL)
        lastViewed              (1970 value if never viewed)
        lastViewedSection       (For sections)
        dataURL                 (String)
        takenAt                 (Place)
        dateupload              (Date)
        dateuploadSection       (String)
    Place
        name                (String)
        hasFavorites        (BOOL)
        photos              (NSSet of Photos)

2: Add button to save a photo as a favorite to PhotoView. This will be on the PhotoViewController's navigation bar.

The favorites view controller becomes a photo table view controller 

3: Add a new tab to the UITabBarViewController with a controller for the Favorites.

4: Store all the recents information to CD rather than NSUserDefaults.

This can be one by just using the lastViewed element of the Photo list... so it becomes a table view of photos with the predicate last viewed < 48 hours ago.

5: Cache photo data for favorites on the file system... straight forward.

6: Make sure Top Places is sorted... but of course it already is, I win.

Design notes:

All photo lists derive from the CoreDataTableViewController... except for the one that shows 


PlacesTableViewController -
    Modify to take a NSManagedObjectContext.

PlacePhotosTableViewController -
    Modify to take a NSManagedObjectContext.
    Modify to create Photos upon photo selection.

- TablesViewControllers from CoreDataTableViewController
 RecentTableViewController
    Sorted by last viewed, grouped by last viewed description

 FavoritePlacesTableViewController
    Sorted by Place Name

 FavoritePhotosInAFavoritePlaceTableViewController
    Sorted by... ?

? When do we create Photo objects?
    In the PlacePhotosTableViewController when they are about to be displayed.

? When do we create a Place object?
    When the Photo object is created if it doesn't already exist.


Modify PhotoViewController to take a Photo object.
